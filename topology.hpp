// here we have the therefore created the macro N 

#define N 9 // N will be the dimension of the board and consequently the input and output number of neuron in this net but can be changed to be applied for other games

#define TEST false // if test is true then we should not save new weight and use the old weight and also not back_prop because we already trained the Net
#define PRINT true  // if PRINT == true -> print the output layer after every Feed Forward of the net
// activation functions
// for now -> than I can add other 
#define ReLU 0
#define Tanh 1

// topology of the network -> this can change I think I will try with {N,12,15,12,N}
#define SIZE 3 // SIZE -> this is the size of the topology
constexpr std::array<const size_t,SIZE> topology = {N,3,N}; // for now the number is arbitrary an really low for testing purposes 

constexpr int count(size_t i){ // this function count the number of weights for a at any point that we have passed (doesn't check for index out of bound)
	int sum = 0;
	for( ; i > 0 ; i--){ sum = sum + (topology[i] * topology[i - 1]);}
    return sum;
}

#define TOTAL_W count(SIZE - 1) // total wights
