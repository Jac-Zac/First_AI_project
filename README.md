# My First AI project

## Synopsis

This is a project that I have created to learn and consolidate my knowledge about AI and DQN. It is now still in the work and I want to shear it with whoever is interested (the project is complitly coded by myself and it is all in c++)

## Code Example
This code will allow you to use a pre-trained model or training a agent by yourself in a reinforcement learning environment by self play. The aim of this project is for now to achieve human level skill in Tic_Tac_Toe

## Motivation
I'm mostly doing this project as a learning experiences but I also want to shear it with the word
