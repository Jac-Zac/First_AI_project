// when I have time I have to code back pro and test it rigorously  
// and also unite everything together

// To do for the future 

// create a replay buffer class and the related components 
// create a multi-threaded function to call epoch with replay buffers with perhaps a large batch size but I have pay attention to the alive variable 

// when you will have finished try to implement it for different tic tac toe rules like the game NOTAKTO
